  This augments master.xml with the L4.verified repositories, in order
  to run the CAmkES-CapDL refinement proofs.

  Note that we don't put the l4v repos directly in projects/, instead
  we wrap them in projects/l4v/. The l4v build system expects a symlink
  to the kernel at the top level, but we can't add that symlink
  directly in projects/. Doing that would confuse the CMake build
  system, as it would blindly include the kernel configuration via the
  symlink and then fail.

    Annoyingly, repo doesn't support adding elements to an existing
    project. (One might try to put them in an extend-project element,
    but that has no effect.) So, we redefine the seL4 project to add
    the symlink element that we want.
